## Von Neumann architectire Virtual Machine
Supports function calling, recursion and static data. Commands and their codes along with register list are in [instructions.py](https://github.com/sopilnyak/mipt-language-concepts/blob/master/vm/instructions.py). Example of running the assembler and disassembler is in [main.py](https://github.com/sopilnyak/mipt-language-concepts/blob/master/vm/main.py).

### Examples
* [fibonacci.asm](https://github.com/sopilnyak/mipt-language-concepts/blob/master/vm/fibonacci.asm) - prints n-th Fibonacci number
* [double.asm](https://github.com/sopilnyak/mipt-language-concepts/blob/master/vm/double.asm) - doubles the given number
